Introduction

Hi, my name is Simren! I recently transitioned from a career as a software development consultant in fintech to pursue my passion for data science. With a background in computer science and an interest in knowing more about the world of data, I decided to do a three-month intensive bootcamp to jumpstart my journey into data science.

My Background
My bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science and AI has given me a strong foundation in programming, algorithms and data structures. For the past four years I worked as a software developer responsible for platform (Avaloq) implementation in addition to data reconciliation, migration and reporting. While I enjoyed my work, I wanted a new challenge. I remember when I was at university the topics I most enjoyed were those which involved machine learning and data analysis. Having now gained greater confidence in my coding abilities from my work experience, I decided to pursue a three-month bootcamp in data science. 

Choosing the Bootcamp
I wanted a bootcamp with in-person teaching since I tend learn better in a classroom setting compared to online. After researching various bootcamps in London, I chose BrainStation. Its data science curriculum appeared to be the most comprehensive and seemed to align with what I wanted to learn in addition to offering a hands-on approach that I was looking for.
